DBT - Dialectical Behavior Therapy App
======================================

### Problem Statement
DBT involves the use of diary cards (sometimes to be filled out multiple times a day on paper) and group learning of skills broken down into modules. These activies require lots of paper that could be built into an app that helps the user track their diary data and skill building without having to carry around a sheet of paper or binder.

### Market Research
An app specifically for iOS already exists but does not exist for the web or android.

### User Persona
The users of this web app will be those immersed in a DBT program and would like to use their electronic devices rather than paper to track/document their progress. The app will also give the user greater accountability as it can be accessed on any electronic device.

The Social Consumer
===================

### Problem Statement
A lot of opinions and feedback on product experience is indirectly expressed via social media outlets. This app will aggregate consumer opinion on specific products or experiences by searching social media sites as well as provide the most popular news articles or reviews on that specific product so that a consumer may make wiser purchasing decisions.

### Market Research
There are plenty of consumer opinion sites but none dedicated specifically to aggregating social media posts that I could find.

### User Persona
The user of this app is someone who likes to do their research before purchasing a product. They like to gather the opinions of others prior to making a decision on a particular purchase.

MEET FRIENDS APP
================
Import facebook likes, added interests to let you know when someone else with the app shares the same interests as you is nearby. 

Nonprofit
=========

### Problem Statement
Smaller nonprofits usually do not have the resources to develop or hire developers to create much needed apps. I plan to either seek out a nonprofit in the local area to determine what need there is for developer volunteers or aggregate a list of nonprofits with needs like this (if there are a lot).
